# HTML Learning Project

This project was created as a learning exercise to explore a wide range of HTML tags and understand their functionality. Below is a summary of my experience with each tag:

## Basic Structure and Text

* **`<h1>` to `<h3>`:** Heading tags, used for structuring content with varying levels of importance (`<h1>` being the most important).  Learned about establishing a clear heading hierarchy for better SEO and accessibility.

* **`<hr>`:**  Horizontal rule, used to create visual separation between sections.  Simple yet effective for readability.

* **`<p>`:** Paragraph tag, essential for text content. Used `<br>` within paragraphs for line breaks, useful for short lines like poems or addresses.

* **`<div>` & `<span>`:** Learned the difference between block-level (`<div>`) and inline (`<span>`) elements. `div` is used for grouping elements and applying styles/scripts to sections, whereas `span` styles/manipulates smaller portions of text within a larger block.

## Lists

* **`<ol>`:** Ordered lists, for numbered items. Experimented with `type` (numbering style) and `start` attributes.

* **`<ul>`:** Unordered lists, for unranked items.  Learned about different bullet point styles using the `type` attribute.

* **Nested Lists:** Practiced creating hierarchical list structures by nesting `<ul>` or `<ol>` within each other.

## Media and Links

* **`<img>`:** Image tag for displaying images. Learned the importance of the `alt` attribute for accessibility.

* **`<a>`:** Anchor tag for creating hyperlinks.  Used the `href` attribute to specify the URL.

## Forms

* **`<form>`:** Form element for user interaction and data submission. Explored the `action` and `method` attributes.

* **Input Types:** Experimented with various input types like `text`, `password`, `email`, `number`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `submit`, `reset`, `button`, `date`, `datetime-local`, `time`, `color`, `file`, `range`, `search`, `tel`, and `url`.

* **`<textarea>`:** Multi-line text input area for longer text entry.

* **`<select>`:** Dropdown list of options.

* **`<label>`:**  Used labels with the `for` attribute linked to input `id` for improved accessibility.

## Tables

* **`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`:** Learned how to structure tables using these tags to organize data in rows and columns.

* **Nested Tables:**  Practiced nesting tables within each other for presenting complex datasets.

## Frames and Embedded Content (For learning, not recommended practice)

* **`<frameset>` & `<frame>`:** Learned (but would avoid using) framesets for dividing the browser window, noting their outdated nature.

* **`<iframe>`:**  Inline frames, for embedding external content like YouTube videos or maps.

## Multimedia

* **`<audio>`:** Embedding audio content, using the `controls` attribute.

* **`<video>`:** Embedding video content, also with the `controls` attribute.

## Canvas and SVG

* **`<canvas>`:** Learned that `<canvas>` provides a drawing surface manipulated with JavaScript for graphics and animations.

* **`<svg>`:**  Used Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for creating vector graphics directly within HTML.


## Conclusion

This project provided valuable hands-on experience with a variety of HTML tags.  By experimenting and seeing their effects, I've gained a deeper understanding of HTML structure and content presentation, which are fundamental skills for web development.
